# Abstract

High level synthesis is a rapidly growing area of research in the FPGA world.
The goal of high level synthesis is to facilitate the design of hardware at a
level of abstraction above the Register Transfer Level (RTL).  This thesis
investigates two aspects of high level synthesis.  Firstly, it investigates the
effect of compiler optimizations on the performance of hardware produced by high
level synthesis tools.  Secondly, it investigates the potential use of high
level synthesis in conjunction with decompilers to generate hardware that
exactly matches the behaviour of an executable software program but with much
better performance.
