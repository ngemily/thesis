# Conclusion

While a proof of concept has been accomplished for binary synthesis, there
remains a lot to be done.  There are a number of black boxes in this process,
wherein many transformations can take place and it is unclear how some aspects
of the input may affect the results.  It has been shown that very subtle changes
in the input program can greatly affect the characteristics of the generated
hardware in terms of area, latency and fmax.
